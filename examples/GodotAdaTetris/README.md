# GodotAdaTetris

IMPORTANT: Please note this is essentially a conversion of the [UnityAdaTetris](https://github.com/AdaCore/UnityAdaTetris) project by AdaCore. Please go check out their [repo](https://github.com/AdaCore/UnityAdaTetris) and their [blog post](https://blog.adacore.com/unity-ada) on combining Unity and Ada.

Some alterations have been made to the `game_loop` packages since I don't need to have a C# component to the project anymore. I can do the entire game code from within the GDNative script.

Please see the license at the top of the relevant Ada files in `src` that were taken from their project. All rights go to them for that code.
